# GaussianBroadening
! ! Purpose : Perform a Gaussian broadening on a set of impulse signal ! data as input. !           Sigma will be calculated from the height of the impulses  signal. !           You must input the range and the step of the output data in !           the proper order. !           No output file to be written, since it is designed to output !           to standard screen !           so as to work with gnuplot, as usage shown below. !           if you want to get an output file with final data, !           uncomment related 2 lines. !           you would get 'g-broadened.dat' ! Usage:  ./command input_file min max step sigma ! UsageEx : plot '&lt; gbroad.x input.dat width Xmin Xmax Xstep &lt; ' u 1:2 ! ... !           in which, width     : FWHM, full width at half maximum,        e.g., 3.0 !                     Xmin, Xmax: the range of X in output, e.g., 500          3000 !                     Xstep     : the increment of X in the output,  e.g., 2 !
